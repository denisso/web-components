# Web Components Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of reusable **Web Components** built using modern web standards. Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable, and encapsulated HTML elements. This project aims to provide a library of components that can be easily integrated into any web application.

## Features

- **Custom Elements**: Create your own HTML elements with custom behavior.
- **Shadow DOM**: Encapsulate styles and markup to avoid conflicts with other parts of the application.
- **HTML Templates**: Use `<template>` and `<slot>` to define reusable markup structures.
- **ES Modules**: Components are written using JavaScript modules for better organization and reusability.
- **Cross-Framework Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with any JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) or no framework at all.
